This requires:

* Dot points of required input data and information


For example:

* One or two examples of what is being tested in biological terms e.g. "What genes are differentially expressed in epithelial cells in Crohn's disease vs healthy individuals?"




Steps:

1. Breif description of steps involved in test
2. If appropriate.





# Worked example 

Long example on real dataset. 



# Code Snippet

Copy and paste this bit into your own script to adapt to your own data.
