# Overview

Once we have identified cell types present in the samples, its common to test how
gene expression changes between experimental conditions, within each different cell type. 


Some cell types may be dramatically affected by the experimental conditions, while others are not. Likewise some genes may change only in a specific cell type, whereas others show a more general difference.


This document describes how to apply a *pseudobulk* approach to test for differences between groups. In a pseudobulk approach counts are obtained by pooling together groups of cells; in this case cells from the of the same celltype from the same fov. These pooled counts can then be analysed more like a bulk RNAseq experiment. 

This is very similar to how a non-spatial single cell experiment may be analysed. 

However, unlike a non-spatial single cell experiment, this experimental design has multiple FOVs from the same tissue sample; these *pseudoreplicates* are informative but cannot be considered true biological replicates. They can be incorporated into the statistics with the correlate duplicates approach [@smythUseWithinarrayReplicate2005].


Note that there are many other approaches to calculate differential expression in this kind of data - including those that make use of individual cells; see review [@Soneson2017].

![](assets/insitu_spatial_pseudobulk_de.png)

This test requires:

* Biological replicates for each group
* Assigned cell types
* [Optionally] Multiple fovs measured per sample


For example:

* What genes are differentially expressed in epithelial cells in Crohn's disease vs healthy individuals?
* How do genes change with treatment in each different cell type in my sample?


Steps:

1. Calculate pseudobulk
2. Filter to testable pseudobulk groups (enough cells to pool)
3. Filter to testable genes (enough expression to see changes)
4. Test for changes in gene expression
5. Plot DE results and individual genes. 


# Worked example 

How does gene expression change within each cell type between Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and Healthy controls?

Using data from [_Macrophage and neutrophil heterogeneity at single-cell spatial resolution in human inflammatory bowel disease_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37495570)
from [@garrido-trigoMacrophageNeutrophilHeterogeneity2023];

The study included 9 cosmx slides of colonic biopsies

* 3x HC - Healthy controls
* 3x UC - Ulcerative colitis
* 3x CD - Chrones's disease

## Experimental design

<!-- Move this to own page? --->

There are three individuals per condition, one tissue sample from each individual. 9 slides in total. Each tissue sample has multiple FOVs captured; these are our pseudoreplicates. Each 'sample' is listed below.


NB: *'FOV' Feild Of View*: In the seurat package, an number of functions include an 'fov' parameter. This corresponds to the slide on which one or more samples are present on. In the cosMX output an 'fov' refers to the rectangular regions on the slide that are measured; there are multiple fovs per slide. This document uses the latter.


```{r}
sample_table <- select(as_tibble(so@meta.data), condition, individual_code, fov_name) %>%
  unique() %>% 
  group_by(condition, individual_code) %>% 
  summarise(n_fovs= n(), item = str_c(fov_name, collapse = ", "))

DT::datatable(sample_table)
```





## Cell filtering and counting 



We need to define the grouping that will make one pseudobulk sample for analysis. 
In this experiment, we can consider all FOVs within a tissue sample as somewhat equivalent. 
Therefore that is all cells of a particular celltype within an FOV region.

If we only had one fov per sample, *celltype + sample* would be directly equivalent.

If we had a tiled fovs across a tissue sample with distinct regions it would be necessary to group them by *subregion fov + celltype*. Alternatively pool the entire sample if each one is equivalent - it depends on where transcriptional differences are expected.



Once the pseudobulk replicate grouping is decided, we need to check there will be enough cells 
to perform our analyses. Note there are several levels of filtering here!

* Need at least x reads in a cell to include it
* Need at least x cells of a celltype within an fov to include a sample
* Can only test where we have at least 2 samples on each side of a contrast.


What these thresholds should be needs to be determined for each experiment.


### Filter counts per cell

To start, check out the distribution of reads per cell. Here, we choose and apply a filter of 200 reads.
This is low compared to what you might see in a single scRNAseq experiment, but we are working with only 1000 genes.


```{r}
min_reads_per_cell <- 200

ggplot(so@meta.data, aes(x=nCount_RNA)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = min_reads_per_cell, lty=3) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("How many reads per cell?")


so<- so[,so$nCount_RNA >= min_reads_per_cell]
```


### Filter cells per group

Next we pool each celltype within each fov (naming those groupings fov_cluster). But there needs to be a certain number of cells for that to work - less than a certain number of cells and a pseudobulk pool will be excluded. The table below shows the cells per grouping.

Note there are much fewer t-cells overall, but given that we have a high number of samples, there should still be enough to include.  Its typical that some of the less common cell types are difficult or impossible to reliably test.

```{r}
min_cells_per_fovcluster <- 20

so$fov_cluster <- paste0(so$fov_name,"_", so$celltype_subset)

celltype_summary_table <- so@meta.data %>% 
  group_by(condition, group, individual_code, fov_name, celltype_subset, fov_cluster) %>%
  summarise(cells=n(), .groups = 'drop')
DT::datatable(celltype_summary_table)
```


```{r}
ggplot(celltype_summary_table, aes(x=cells, col=celltype_subset)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=min_cells_per_fovcluster, lty=3) +
  geom_rug() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("How many cells per fov-cluster?")
```


Record the names of those fov_clusters that contain enough cells to be used. 
Will use this later to filter.
```{r}
celltype_summary_table.passed <- celltype_summary_table[celltype_summary_table$cells >= min_cells_per_fovcluster,]
passed_fov_clusters <- celltype_summary_table.passed$fov_cluster
```

### Samples per contrast.

Ignoring pseodureplicate fovs from a single sample, how many bioloical samples are represented in our filtered table?

In this experiment, there are enough samples to run the contrasts for every cell type.

```{r}
celltype_summary_table.passed %>% select(condition, individual_code, celltype_subset) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(condition, celltype_subset) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider( names_from=condition, values_from = n)
```


NB: What if you do need to skip constrasts? Often its easiest to count your biological replicates at the differential expression step and skip them there. You might need to run contrasts between groups one at a time to do this. 


## Calculate pseudobulk

Now use the _PseudobulkExpression()_ function to sum up each gene's gene expression across each *fov_cluster*. 

```{r}
pseudobulk_counts <- PseudobulkExpression(so, assays = "RNA", layer="counts",  method = 'aggregate', group.by = 'fov_cluster')
pseudobulk_counts_matrix <- pseudobulk_counts[["RNA"]]

# Change - back to _. Ideally we'd have neither, but - will cause problems later
colnames(pseudobulk_counts_matrix)<-gsub("-","_",colnames(pseudobulk_counts_matrix))
```


Now instead of counts for each individual cell, we have our pseodubulk matrix 
with the pooled sum of counts for each celltype within each fov region. So the numbers are much higher, with fewer zeros. 
But note that each pool is a different size, so we can't compare counts directly. We will address this later with normalisation. 

```{r}
pseudobulk_counts_matrix[1:10,1:4]
```


Next, filter to only those passed fov_clusters we saw earlier - this filtered table is what we'll use for calculating differential expression.  

We also need an annotation table to tell us what is in each fov_cluster (sample, celltype, condition...). Build this by filtering the celltype summary table made earlier.

For convenience we filter it to the same samples, in the same order as the pseudobulk matrix, so we can then use those columns of data to build our differential expression model in the next step. We need to be careful the order remains the same.

```{r}
# Filter the pseudobulk table
pseudobulk_counts_matrix <- pseudobulk_counts_matrix[,passed_fov_clusters]

# And filter the celltype summary into an annotation table for only those fov_clusters
# pull in relevant annotation in a matched order
pseudobulk_anno_table <- celltype_summary_table
match_order <- match(passed_fov_clusters, pseudobulk_anno_table$fov_cluster)
pseudobulk_anno_table <- pseudobulk_anno_table[match_order,]

# Double check that the order of samples in the annotation table matches the pseudobulk table. 
# If this is wrong then the results will be nonsense!
stopifnot(all(colnames(pseudobulk_counts_matrix) == pseudobulk_anno_table$fov_cluster  ))
```


## Calculate Differential Expression

We now have a counts matrix, and an annotation table that describes its samples.

This looks very much like a bulk RNAseq experiment. Except - instead of X samples across Y conditions, we have X samples of Y conditions for each of Z celltypes.


```{r}
pseudobulk_counts_matrix[1:10,1:4]
head(pseudobulk_anno_table)
```

We will use a fairly standard limma differential expression analysis. 

We will process each celltype one at a time as follows:

1) Subset the counts matrix and annotation table to the celltype.
2) Build and fit the model. In our case, a simple one that looks for various by disease group, blocked on individual.
3) Run the test.

How to build the model and run the test will need to be customised for your experimental design. Online resources that describe approaches for bulk RNAseq analyses can be applied to pseudobulk analyses - see the 'More Information' section of this document for suggestions. 


In this case the line `model.matrix( ~0 + group)` builds a model where gene expression
is expected to vary by group (UC/CD/HC). The ~0 part indicates a 'intercept', which is convenient because it means we can include all 3 groups in our contrasts, rather than one of them being treated as the baseline. ( NB: Mathematically, you could use ~group alone without intercept, and define contrasts accordingly to get the same result. )

But, we also need to take into account our individuals. We do this by *blocking* on individual, and calculating a intra duplicate correlation with _duplicateCorrelation()_[@smythUseWithinarrayReplicate2005]. That's a method from microarray times, see [discussion](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/125489/) for how it is applied to bulk RNAseq data.

If instead we didn't have multiple fovs per replicate, can skip blocking or use of duplicateCorrelation(). That is more typical of a typical of a bulk rnaseq or single cell RNAseq pseuobulk analysis.

Some example models:

* **~0 + group, (blocked on individual with using duplicate Correlation)** : Used here, takes into account pseodureplicate fovs from the same samples
* **~0 + group, (no blocking or duplicate correlation)** : If there was only one pseudoreplicate per individual. Either from a single fov, or from pooling fovs. 
* **~0 + group + individual (no blocking or duplicate correlation)** : If this was a treatment / time point experiment with paired samples from individuals. But only one pseodureplicate per individual. If there were multiple fovs per tissue sample, you could add blocking and duplicate correlation on tissue ID.
* **~0 + group + celltype** (with or without blocking + duplicate correlation) : Instead of subsetting to celltype, includes cell type in the model. This pulls more data into the stataticacs, but makes building the contrasts challenging! Not covered here.

## DE plots

The below plots show the logFC calculate for each gene versus its average expression across all samples. This is a useful diagnostic plot to evaluate your differential expression results.

* Only big changes are significant at lower expressions, simply becuase higher expression means more statistical confidence.
* A lopsided plot might indicate some oddness around the normalisation of your data (e.g. extremely different cell counts).

p3 <- make_ma_style_plot(res_table = filter(de_results_all, contrast == "UCvHC", celltype=="stroma")) + ggtitle("UC vs HC - stroma")

p1 + p2 + p3

```






## Check some examples

Its always worth visualising how the expression of your differentially expressed genes really looks, with respect to your experimental design. How best to do this depends on your experiment. 


The results suggests that TNFRSF18 was significantly DE between individuals with Ulcerative Colitis and Healthy Controls in plasma cells. As a first step, there's some very convenient seurat plots below;

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
p1 <- VlnPlot(subset(so, celltype_subset == "plasmas"), features = "TNFRSF18", group.by = 'group', alpha = 0.1)
p2 <- FeaturePlot(so, "TNFRSF18", split.by = "group")
p1 / p2
```

But it gets difficult to summarise data at the single cell level. We can also use the the normalised pseudobulk expression to see how gene expression varies within each fov,individual,celltype and condition - The plot below shows an overview of normalised TNFRSF18 expression across the entire experiment. 

```{r}
# Get tmm normalised coutns for all pseudobulk
# WHen we did the DE we calculated this a celltype at a time, so values might differ slightly!
dge <- DGEList(pseudobulk_counts_matrix)
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
norm_pseudobulk <- cpm(dge , log=TRUE) # uses tmm normalisation

# Plot expression for TNFRSF18
plottable <- cbind(pseudobulk_anno_table, expression = norm_pseudobulk["TNFRSF18",])
ggplot(plottable, aes(x=individual_code, y=expression, col=condition )) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0)) + 
  facet_wrap(~celltype_subset) 

```


Compared with IGHG1, which was flagged at differentially expressed across multiple cell types.

```{r}
plottable <- cbind(pseudobulk_anno_table, expression = norm_pseudobulk["IGHG1",])
ggplot(plottable, aes(x=individual_code, y=expression, col=condition )) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0)) + 
  facet_wrap(~celltype_subset) 
```
