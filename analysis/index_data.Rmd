These examples assume that the data has been loaded, preprocessed (e.g. QC-ed, UMAP) and annotated (e.g. sample names, cell types, cell niches). For information, the preprocessing applied here is included in data preparation below. Please note that these are not full annotations, and do not aim to reproduce the authors' published analyses! These are much simplified simply as a way to run these tests.
