# Overview


Sometimes there are no biological replicates, yet you still want to make a comparison. While not ideal, its possible. Individual cells may be treated as 'replicates' to explore the difference between two samples.


![](assets/de_1v1.png)


This requires:

* Cell clusters
* 2 or more samples (or grouping to compare)


For example:

* What genes are differentially expressed between the knockout (n=1) and control(n=1), for every cell type.
* In my n=1 pilot study - what is differentially expressed between two of my stromal clusters?


Steps:

1. Filter to testable genes (enough expression to see changes)
2. Test for changes in gene expression
3. Plot DE results and individual genes. 


## Gotchas


**Caveat on 1 vs 1 comparisons!**

Essentially the results we get will be testing the difference between *this* specific sample and *that* specific sample. The p-values for such a test can be very significant!

But those p-values can't be compared to those using multiple samples, and we cannot tell if our results will generalise to other samples. They are likely good candidates for further work though!

**But what about pooled samples? **

Note that 'pooling' multiple unlabelled biological samples before library prep will still count as 'one' replicate no many how many samples are in the pool - because we have no way to tell what sample a cell comes from. A change in gene expression could be from a single outlier sample.

NB: Using cell hashing approaches to tag samples before pooling avoids this issue.




# Worked example 

The data for this example is from paper [Forming nephrons promote nephron progenitor maintenance and branching morphogenesis via paracrine BMP4 signalling under the control of Wnt4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.19.567482v1.full) [@moreauFormingNephronsPromote2023a]

This study included 10X chromium single cell RNAseq data from 4 conditions, with 3-4 E14.5 mice pooled per group. 

* Sample1 (Wnt4FloxKO):  Wnt4Flox/Flox Six2-Conditional Wnt4 Knockout
* Sample2 (Wnt4FloxHet):  Wnt4Flox/+ Six2-Conditional Wnt4 Het
* Sample3 (Wnt4Het): Wnt4 GCE/+ Control Wnt4 Het
* Sample4 (Wnt4KO): Wnt4 GCE/GCE Knockout Wnt4

In that paper they explain that complete or conditional homozygous knockout of Wnt4 gene results in abnormal kidney development, and they use scRNAseq data to explore effects at cellular level. [@moreauFormingNephronsPromote2023a]


In this vignette, we will test for differential expression in each cell type for two 1 vs 1 comparisons:

* Wnt4KO vs Wnt4Het : Complete knockout vs heterozgote
* Wnt4FloxKO vs Wnt4FloxHet : Conditional (Flox) knockout vs heterozygote


## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(edgeR)
library(limma)
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)


dataset_dir      <- '~/projects/spatialsnippets/datasets'
seurat_file      <- file.path(dataset_dir, 'Wnt4KO_Moreau2023',  "Wnt4KOE14.5_11_ss.rds")

so <- readRDS(seurat_file)
```


## Experimental Design


In this case the sample (sample 1-4), 'genotype' GT effect and GT short columns are just different labels for this same groups.  We will use GTshort as our 'sample' names throughout.

There are between 4000 and 10000 cells per sample. 

```{r}
select(so@meta.data, sample, Genotype, GTeffect, GTshort) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  group_by( sample, Genotype, GTeffect, GTshort) %>%
  summarise(num_cells=n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  DT::datatable()
```


## Filter


### Counts per cell

A minimum-counts-per-cell threshold was already applied to this dataset (during preprocessing) so nothing to do here.


```{r}
# This is plenty
min(so$nCount_RNA)
```


### Cells per group

How many cells are there for each celltype for each sample? If there are too few on either side of the contrast, we won't be able to test. 


How many is too few? 50 might be a good threshold. In this case however, we might 
consider being very permissive and allowing just 20 cells to look at some celltypes that are clearly reduced or increased in number between conditions (e.g. c9,c10,c11). 

They're interesting in this experiment, but have to keep in mind during interpretation that results may be less reliable. 

We will apply that filter later when running the differential expression.

```{r}
min_cells_per_group <- 20 # used later
table(so$CelltypeCode, so$GTshort)
```


## Run just one differential expression


Talk about options. ...


* layer vs assay
* SCT vs RNA 
* count vs data vs data scale
* subsampling
* min.pct

```{r eval=FALSE}
de_result <- FindMarkers(so.this, 
                               ident.1  = 'Wnt4KO', 
                               ident.2  = 'Wnt4Het',
                               slot     = 'data',
                               test.use = "wilcox", # the default
                               min.pct  = 0.01,   # Note 
                               max.cells.per.ident = 100 # 1000 # if you have really big clusters, set this to subsample!
                               )
  

```



## Run differential expression for every cluster

We typically want to know about changes in every cluster. We can simply loop through and run them one-by-one. This can make for a lot of contrasts!

```
2x comparisons * 19x clusters = 38 sets of differential results 
```

The below code makes a big table of all the tests - recording which contrast was being done in which cluster.



NB: Note that the _FindMarkers()_ function returns a table with feature names as a rowname. Rownames are expected to be unique. So while that is fine for one comparison, but when we want to put more together, we need to give it its own column. If we don't, there'll be gene names with '.1' appended to the end!


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Set threhoehsolds
min_cells_per_group <- 20

# Calculate DE across every celltype
# Empty list to collect results
de_result_list     <- list()
de_result_sig_list <- list()

# the contrasts
# If we store them in a list we can give the nice names
contrast_list <-  list( # 'Test'      vs  'control'  
                       FloxWnt4KOvsFloxHet  = c('Wnt4FloxKO',      'Wnt4FloxHet' ) ,
                       TotalWnt4KOvsHet     = c('Wnt4KO',          'Wnt4Het'     ) )

## Or you could autogenerated them
#make_contrast_name <- function(contrast_parts){ paste0(contrast_parts[1],"vs",contrast_parts[1])}
#contrast_names <- sapply(FUN=make_contrast_name, X=contrast_list) 
#names(contrast_list) <- contrast_names


# note keeping all 4 samples before two contrasts. (actually does that matter for wilcox ranK sum - CHECK)

#the_celltype = 'c15: Podocyte'
#the_celltype = "c16: Blood"
#contrast_name <- 'TotalWnt4KOvsHet'
  
for (the_celltype in levels(so$CelltypeCode)[5:7]) {
  
  # Subset to one cell type. 
  print(the_celltype)
  
  so.this <- subset(so, CelltypeCode == the_celltype)
  
  # count how many cells within each sample (GTshort)
  # And list which samples have more than the minimum
  cells_per_sample <- table(so.this$GTshort)
  print(cells_per_sample)
  samples_with_enough_cells <- names(cells_per_sample)[cells_per_sample > min_cells_per_group]
  
  # SUbset to only those samples (might be all cells, might be no cells)
  so.this <- subset(so.this, GTshort %in% samples_with_enough_cells)
  

  # For each listed contrast, do both sides of the contrast have enough cells?
  # This is of course much simpler if you only have one contrast!
  for (contrast_name in names(contrast_list)) {
    
    # from mycontrastname pull out list of the two samples involved;
    # c('test', 'control')
    contrast <- contrast_list[[contrast_name]]
    
    # Only run this contrast if both sides pass!
    if (all(contrast %in% samples_with_enough_cells)) {
      print(contrast_name) 

      # We need to tell Seurat to group by _sample_ not cluster.
      Idents(so.this) <- so.this$GTshort
      
      
      de_result <- FindMarkers(so.this, 
                               ident.1  = contrast[1], 
                               ident.2 = contrast[2],

      # It can be helpful to know the average expression of a gene
      # This will give us the average (per cell) within this celltype.
      avg_expression <- rowMeans(GetAssayData(so.this, assay = 'SCT', layer="data"))

## Check individual results

Plot some example genes.


Discuss (how to pick stuff thats real)

* further filtering - where small significant changes dominate
* violin plots are hard to read
* MA style plots.

# Results

```{r eval=FALSE}

```

* **celltype**: The cluster or celltype the contrat is within. Added by running code.
* **contrast**: The name of what is being compared. Added by running code.
* **target** : Gene name. (NB: Added by our running code, in the direct output of  FindMarkers(), these are row names instead)
* **avg_expression** : Average expression of target within celltype group. (Added by running code)
* **p_val** : P value without multiple hypothesis correction - see *p_val_adj* 
* **avg_log2FC** : Average log 2 fold change of the comparison. Is calculated as: _log2(test expression) - log2(control expression)_ A value of 0 represents no change, +1 is a doubling, and -1 is a halving of expression.
* **pct.1** : Percent of cells in group 1 (generally test) that express the gene at all.
* **pct.2** : Percent of cells in group 2 (generally control/WT/reference) that express the gene at all.
* **p_val_adj** : Pvalue with multiple hypothesis correction. This may be used for filtering.
