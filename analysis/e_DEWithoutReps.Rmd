# Overview

*<DIAGRAM>*
 
Sometimes there are no biological replicates, yet you still want to make a comparison.

E.g.

* Differences betwee two similar clusters in a single sample pilot
* A 1 vs 1 comparison, where replicates simply aren't available



# Example Problem
 
Compare the difference between two XXXX subtypes...


More context around test 
```{ r eval=FALSE}

# Load data

# Look at columns


```


# Code Snippet

Just the test. The bit to be copy-pasted into analysis code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# DefaultAssay() <- 
#FindMarkers


```
