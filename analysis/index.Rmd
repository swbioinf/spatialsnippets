These examples are a sampler of tests that can be performed on an in-situ single cell spatial dataset.
Examples use cosmx, should be valid on other platforms like xenium.

Further details on the papers, tools, statistics and methods are linked from each page.


Testing... few entries, and not yet organised.

## In situ spatial

We have fovs and some ideas how to use them.

* [Test for different cell type composition by group](e_CompositionChange.html)
* [Differential Expresison by celltypes, between groups ](e_DEPseudobulk_insitu.html)



# Data preparation

* [IBD cosmx dataset](d_cosmxIBD.html) :  [_Macrophage and neutrophil heterogeneity at single-cell spatial resolution in human inflammatory bowel disease_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37495570) from Garrido-Trigo et al 2023.
