These examples are a sampler of tests that can be performed on an spatial dataset. Further details on the papers, tools, statistics and methods are linked from each page.

Testing... nothing useful here yet.

## Differential Expression (core)

Ways of testing differential expression
* Differential expression with pseudobulk
* Differential expression between groups (no replicates)
* Differential expression, using cell level information

## Differential expression applied

Ways of selection for differential expression
* Test for differential expression by condition in all celltypes
* Test for differential expression by different cell niches.
* Test for differential expression by proximity to celltype

## Proportional changes

* [Test for different cell type composition by group](e_CompositionChange.html)

## Spatial hypotheses

* Identify spatially restricted genes
* Identify spatially co-expressed or adjacent genes



# Data preparation

* [IBD cosmx dataset](d_cosmxIBD.html) :  [_Macrophage and neutrophil heterogeneity at single-cell spatial resolution in human inflammatory bowel disease_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37495570) from Garrido-Trigo et al 2023.
