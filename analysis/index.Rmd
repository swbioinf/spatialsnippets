These examples are a sampler of tests that can be performed on an in-situ single cell spatial datasets. Initial  examples use cosMX, though approaches should be valid on other platforms like Xenium. 

Further details on the papers, tools, statistics and methods are linked from each page.

Each example presents just one way of doing things (and currently only with Seurat) - there are many, many other approaches! These are intended as a starting point.


* [Test for different cell type composition by group](e_CompositionChange.html):  Looking at proportions of celltypes, within in-situ spatial single cell datasets (cosmx). 
* [Differential Expression by celltypes, between groups ](e_DEPseudobulk_insitu.html): Looking at differential expression, celltype by celltype, within in-situ spatial single cell datasets (cosmx)
* [Differtial expression without replicates with scRNAseq](e_DEWithoutReps.html) : For scRNAseq data, compare gene expresison cluster by cluster, between two samples, where no replicates are available. 

<!-- * [Changes in cell neighbourhood, between groups ](e_neighbourcellchanges.html): WIP -->


These examples assume that the data has been loaded, preprocessed (e.g. QC-ed, UMAP) and annotated (e.g. sample names, cell types, cell niches). For information on how each dataset was prepared, see the data tab.
