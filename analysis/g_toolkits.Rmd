For visium data. No official cosmx support?

* Successor to STutility
* Looks to be exfcellent for extracting sets of cells making up spatial features
   - Distance from a feature
   - Cells bordering on a region
   - gene's spatial autocorrelation (faster alternative to moransI)



## Voyager

Within bioconductor / SpatialExperiment ecocsystem.

A focus on spatial tests, as drawn from geospatial methods.
