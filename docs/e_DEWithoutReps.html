The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/swbioinf/spatialsnippets/tree/ca62223f695fa56ddcf8f1a5af89d767c8a678a3" target="_blank">ca62223</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    analysis/e_neighbourcellchanges.nb.html
    Ignored:    analysis/glossary.nb.html
    Ignored:    renv/library/
    Ignored:    renv/staging/

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Sometimes there are no biological replicates, yet you still want to
make a comparison. While not ideal, its possible. Individual cells may
be treated as ‘replicates’ to explore the difference between two
samples.</p>
<p><img src="assets/de_1v1.png" /></p>
<p>This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell clusters</li>
<li>2 or more samples (or grouping to compare)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What genes are differentially expressed between the knockout (n=1)
and control(n=1), for every cell type.</li>
<li>In my n=1 pilot study - what is differentially expressed between two
of my stromal clusters?</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Filter to testable genes (enough expression to see changes)</li>
<li>Test for changes in gene expression</li>
<li>Plot DE results and individual genes.</li>
</ol>
<div id="gotchas" class="section level2">
<h2>Gotchas</h2>
<p><strong>Caveat on 1 vs 1 comparisons!</strong></p>
<p>Essentially the results we get will be testing the difference between
<em>this</em> specific sample and <em>that</em> specific sample. The
p-values for such a test can be very significant!</p>
<p>But those p-values can’t be compared to those using multiple samples,
and we cannot tell if our results will generalise to other samples. They
are likely good candidates for further work though!</p>
<p><strong>But what about pooled samples? </strong></p>
<p>Note that ‘pooling’ multiple unlabelled biological samples before
library prep will still count as ‘one’ replicate no many how many
samples are in the pool - because we have no way to tell what sample a
cell comes from. A change in gene expression could be from a single
outlier sample.</p>
<p>NB: Using cell hashing approaches to tag samples before pooling
avoids this issue.</p>

<div id="worked-example" class="section level1">
<h1>Worked example</h1>
<p>The data for this example is from paper <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.19.567482v1.full">Forming
nephrons promote nephron progenitor maintenance and branching
morphogenesis via paracrine BMP4 signalling under the control of
Wnt4</a> <span class="citation">(Moreau et al. 2023)</span></p>
<p>This study included 10X chromium single cell RNAseq data from 4
conditions, with 3-4 E14.5 mice pooled per group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample1 (Wnt4FloxKO): Wnt4Flox/Flox Six2-Conditional Wnt4
Knockout</li>
<li>Sample2 (Wnt4FloxHet): Wnt4Flox/+ Six2-Conditional Wnt4 Het</li>
<li>Sample3 (Wnt4Het): Wnt4 GCE/+ Control Wnt4 Het</li>
<li>Sample4 (Wnt4KO): Wnt4 GCE/GCE Knockout Wnt4</li>
</ul>
<p>In that paper they explain that complete or conditional homozygous
knockout of Wnt4 gene results in abnormal kidney development, and they
use scRNAseq data to explore effects at cellular level. <span
class="citation">(Moreau et al. 2023)</span></p>
<p>In this vignette, we will test for differential expression in each
cell type for two 1 vs 1 comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wnt4KO vs Wnt4Het : Complete knockout vs heterozgote</li>
<li>Wnt4FloxKO vs Wnt4FloxHet : Conditional (Flox) knockout vs
heterozygote</li>

<div id="what-dataassaylayer-do-we-actually-need"
class="section level2">
<h2>What data/assay/layer do we actually need?</h2>
<p>In short - we want to run this differential expression on the
normalised data, and typically that’s in the <em>data</em> layer of the
<em>RNA</em> assay.</p>
<hr />
<p>The longer explaination:</p>
<p>From seurat v5, a Seruat object has mutiple <em>assays</em> (but
usually just one, called RNA), each of which has multiple
<em>layers</em>.</p>
<p>Each <em>assay</em> generally has some or all of the following
layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>counts</strong> : Just the plain old counts matrix.</li>
<li><strong>data</strong> : A normalised counts matrix</li>
<li><strong>scale.data</strong> : A normalised and scaled counts matrix,
which often only contains a subset of the highly variable genes. (Used
for PCA e.t.c)</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how you setup your object, you might have one set of
counts/data/scale.data layers per sample. (e.g. counts.sample1,
counts.sample2 …). In that case you’ll want to proceed with differential
expression on a merged layer - which you can produce with the
JoinLayers() function. See how that’s used in <a
href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration#layers-in-the-seurat-v5-object">seurats
v5 integration tutorial</a></p>
<p>Multiple assays come into play more often with multimodal data - a
different assay per modality (RNA, ADT, e.t.c). See <a
href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette">multimodal
vigette</a> for details.</p>
<p>Beware: The notation around Layers and Assays has changed between
Seurat v4 and v5! In older seurat objects ‘assay’ is used to refer to v5
layers.</p>
<hr />
<p>This dataset however is a little different.It was analysed with an
earlier version of Seurat, and has ended up with two assays; an RNA and
an SCT assay. NB: The newer <a
href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration#layers-in-the-seurat-v5-object">seurat
5 integration workflow</a> behaves differently now, and doesn’t make
that assay like that.</p>

<pre><code>[1] &quot;RNA&quot; &quot;SCT&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>DefaultAssay(so)</code></pre>

 1 other assay present: RNA

<p>In any case, we want the unintegrated ‘RNA’ assay for calculating
differential expression, not our integrated SCT assay (This is the
reccomendation of the Seurat developers, see <a
href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/discussions/4032">discussion</a>
) The between sample integration was useful for visualising the
cell-cell relationships together (e.g. superimposing samples on a UMAP
layout), but for differential expression, we need to look at the
variation between samples.</p>

<h2>Run just one differential expression</h2>
<p>Lets say we want to test the differnece between samples Wnt4KO and
Wnt4Het within Nephron progenitors (NP),</p>
<p>We first need to setup our object for use with the
<em>FindMarkers</em> function that runs differential expression.</p>
<p>Though we can specify our layer with the slot parameter, there’s no
parameter for assay in FindMarkers, you need to make sure your assay is
the one you want to use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>DefaultAssay(so)</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;RNA&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>DefaultAssay(so) &lt;- &quot;RNA&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, there’s no paremeter to specify which column of the
metadata out groups may be found in. We instead set Indents()</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Idents(so) &lt;- so$GTshort
levels(Idents(so))</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;Wnt4FloxHet&quot; &quot;Wnt4FloxKO&quot;  &quot;Wnt4Het&quot;     &quot;Wnt4KO&quot;     </code></pre>
<p>Now make a subset of our seurat object that’s just the NP cells.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>so.np &lt;- subset(so, CelltypeCode == &quot;c3: NP&quot;)

       6836       10511        8340        4103 </code></pre>
<p>Finally - run findmarkers. We will stick with the default method that
uses a wilcoxon rank-sum test (but to explore other tests see the
(seurat DE vignette)[<a
href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/de_vignette"

<p>Some improvements/changes can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is slow</strong>: Add the <em>max.cells.per.ident</em>
parameter to subsample down to a specified maximum number of cells per
group. It can be useful to set a very low number when testing (e.g 20),
then a much higher one (e.g. 500, or no limit at all) for your real run.
NB: If Seurat suggests you install a library called presto to speed this
up, its well worth doing!</li>
<li><strong>Adjust filtering</strong>:
<ul>
<li>By default the results are filtered by a <em>logfc.threshold</em> of
0.1. Consider removing this threshold (set it to 0) if you want to get
stats for genes that are present but unchanging.</li>
<li><em>min.cells.pct</em> by default 0.01, genes with very low
expression in both groups will be ignored. You can’t find differences
when there is that little expression, and keeping them in makes your
multiple hypothesis correction more aggressive. You might consider
disabling this test if you’ve already done your one filtering. But this
default is good enough.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Its quite common practice, especially with so many highly significant
genes (some of which have a small log2FC), to filter our results by
fold-change. Common thresholds are 1 (log2(2) - a doubling or halving of
expression), or log2(1.5) for 1.5fold-changes. Note that threshold is on
‘absolute’ values, so we don’t accidentally exclude downregulation; like

<h2>Run differential expression for every cluster</h2>
<p>We typically want to know about changes in every cluster. This can
make for a lot of contrasts!</p>
<pre><code>2x comparisons * 19x clusters = 38 sets of differential results </code></pre>
<p>We can simply loop through and run them one-by-one. The code below
makes a big table of all the tests - recording which contrast was being
done in which cluster.</p>
<p>NB: Note that the <em>FindMarkers()</em> function returns a table
with feature names as a rowname. Rownames are expected to be unique. So
while that is fine for one comparison, but when we want to put more
together, we need to give it its own column. If we don’t, there’ll be
gene names with ‘.1’ appended to the end!</p>

<p>First step would be a violin plot. Rps29 has very high expresison,
and is in practically every cell. Stc1 is more typical low expression,
but still quite informative. The black line at the bottom of these
violin plots is typical - that’s cells with zero copies of the gene
dominating the plot.</p>

<p>Normalised expression across the umap can give a good overview of how
specific your DE gene is expressed. Can see that there’s alot more
expression of Rps29 overall, and its pretty ubiquitous.</p>

<p>It can also be worth checking how high counts are - note that Stc1
maxes out at 8 copies in a cell. Rps29 looks more specific now - but
many of the low counts are in the grey (this isn’t a good visualisation
for that reason).</p>

<p>If the Seurat default plots aren’t giving enough control for plotting
your experiment; The ‘fetchData’ function builds a table from the
various sources in the seurat data (since gene expression or UMAP
coordinates arne’t in the metadata). You can build your own pretty plots
from there.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
