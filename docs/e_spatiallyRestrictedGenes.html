<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Spatially resticted genes</h1>
<h4 class="author">Sarah Williams</h4>

</div>


<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>It is possible to test for genes that are expressed in a non-random
spatial pattern. These might be restricted to regions of a tissue
(e.g. epithelia), near structures or simply having very high expression
in selected cells only (e.g. immunoglobulins in plasma cells).</p>
<p>One popular approach to find these genes is the MoransI test of
spatial autocorrelation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/spatiallyrestricted.png" /></p>
<p>This example will show how to use the morans test within Seurat to
find spatially restricted genes.</p>
<p>This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>X,Y coordinates of individual transcripts, or their cells.</li>
<li>Annotation of the tissue samples in the cell metadata (if multiple
samples)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no need for celltype annotation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What cells are spatially restricted in this tissue due to some
structure?</li>
<li>Are some cancer-related genes showing a restricted spatial
expression (and does this align with tumour-dense regions?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Subset experiment to each tissue</li>
<li>Calculate Moran’s I for each sample</li>
<li>Join and inspect results</li>
</ol>

class="citation">(Mallach et al. 2024)</span> explores the spatial
transcription of amyloid plaques in a mouse model.</p>
<p>Their work includes an analysis of cosMx samples from of 4 mouse
brain samples.</p>
<p>Those sections show very distinct spatial patterning of gene
expression due to the different brain structures. This example will test
which genes are expressed in a spatially restricted pattern,
independently of any celltype annotations. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Present within or nearby a given structure</li>
<li>Existing in ‘clumps’ e.g. high expression on a small subset of
cells</li>

<h3>Spatially variable features</h3>
<p>Morans test can be slow to run, so save time by only running it on
variable features. Variable features are those with a non-even
distribution across cells, and are routinely deteced with
<em>FindVariableFeatures()</em> during preprocessing. Non variable
features are unlikely to be spatially restricted.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this demo, recalculate just the top 10 variable
features. The actual number for a real experiment could be judged from
the variable features plot below, e.g. 100-200-2000 (or whatever you use
for PCA - it really depends on your panel!).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>num_variable_features = 30 # Test only! Should be much larger. Consider using all your VariableFeatures used for UMAPs, et.c.

<p>We will look for <em>spatially</em> variable features on each of our
tissue samples independently; in this case 4 samples across 2 slides.
But first, just test one.</p>
<p>We do this because all probes are essentially going to be restricted
to the tissue itself, not the surrounding empty slide. This might be
particularly noticeable on a panel of many small cores.</p>
<p>First, subset to just one tissue sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>so.sample &lt;- subset( so, subset= sample == &#39;sample1&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Then find the spatially variable genes with
<em>FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures()</em> function.</p>
<p>That code <em>should</em> look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>so.sample &lt;- FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures(
  so.sample, 
  assay = &quot;RNA&quot;, 
  features = VariableFeatures(so.sample),    
  selection.method = &quot;moransi&quot;,
  layer = &quot;counts&quot;)</code></pre>
<!-- ### OLD BUG -->
<!-- However, right now, there is a bug with the current FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures function, described [here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/8226). Likely that issue will be closed when this is fixed! -->
<!-- If you see the following error - try a workaround, using a customised version of this that avoids the issue in this dataset. The custom version, may be found [here](https://github.com/swbioinf/spatialsnippets/blob/main/code/spatially_variable_features_code.R) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Error in `LayerData<-`: -->
<!-- ! 'layer' must be a single non-empty string -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The adjusted function is called as: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # Workaround  -->
<!-- # Available: https://github.com/swbioinf/spatialsnippets/blob/main/code/spatially_variable_features_code.R -->
<!-- source("code/spatially_variable_features_code.R") -->
<!-- so.sample <- FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures.Seurat_EDITED( -->
<!--   so.sample,  -->
<!--   assay = "RNA",  -->
<!--   features = VariableFeatures(so.sample),     -->
<!--   selection.method = "moransi", -->
<!--   layer = "counts") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>However, right now, there is a bug with the current
<em>FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures()</em> function with this dataset. If
you find the R code segfaults (ie. R exits entirely) with the message
“<em>address (nil), cause ‘memory not mapped’</em>”, consider the
workaroudn below. Also, check issue ticket <a
href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/10099">here</a>, it may
be fixed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>so.sample.assay &lt;- so.sample[[&#39;RNA&#39;]]

different but clear reasons for being spatially restricted. Ptgds and
Penk seem to be restricted to specific regions of the tissue. Wherease
Drd4 seems to have high expression in a subset of cells - its proximity
to itself also triggers the significance n the moransI test.</p>
<p>NB: Genes without any sort of spatial pattern (e.g negative controls)
might still have some sort of moransI test significance - since they’re
still restricted to the tissue itself, it isn’t random.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
